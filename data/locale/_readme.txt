Format of .locale files:
------------------------
character encoding: UTF-8
filename suffix   : .locale

Files must be strictly alphabetically ordered, and must not contain
any empty lines.

Destination of .locale files:
-----------------------------
directory: /var/tuxbox/locale or /share/tuxbox/neutrino/locale

Master file:
------------
english.locale is considered the master file.


Verfication of .locale files:
-----------------------------
Use ./helpers/check-locale for detecting in master file
- violations of the sorting order,
- missing translations and
- legacy strings.



How do I add a new locale string?
---------------------------------
1.)
First of all, add the new string to english.locale while preserving
the ordering. Do not add any empty lines.

2.)
Enter the directory build_tmp/neutrino-hd/data/locale.

3.)
Use for sorting 'make sort-locals', use 'make ordercheck' to for verification.

4.)
To the extent possible, update other locale file. For this, 'make work-locals'
may be useful. if you find a file called *.locale-work, merge this into *.locale

5.)
Create new versions of the files src/system/locals.h and src/system/locals_intern.h
using the command 'make locals.h locals_intern.h'.

6.)
Check the modifications with 'make check'

7.)
Or use for item 3-6 'make locals'

8.)
Copy the replacement file to their destination with 'make install-locals'

9.)
If committing the changes to Git, commit both the involved
locale-files, src/system/locals.h, and src/system/locals_intern.h.
